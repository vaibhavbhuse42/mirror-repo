# Mirror Repository Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explains how to create and configure a Mirror Repository in GitHub.
I have documented all the steps I followed, along with screenshots for clarity.

## ðŸ›  Steps Followed
### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

First, I created a new repository in my GitHub account.

Then I went into the Repository Settings.

In settings, I enabled the Mirror Repository option.

After that, I copied the HTTPS URL of my repository.

### 2. Generate Personal Access Token

I generated a Personal Access Token (PAT) from GitHub.

This token is used for authentication instead of password.

While pushing my code, I entered GitHub username and this token.

### 3. Clone the Repository with Mirror

Then I cloned my repository using the mirror option.

This allows me to create a local copy which syncs with GitHub mirror repo.

### 4. Create Project File

After cloning, I created a file called index.html.

This was just for testing whether the mirror setup works correctly.

Next, I committed my changes.

Then I pushed the file into my GitHub mirror repository.

Successfully, the file appeared on my repository.

## ðŸš€ Final Output

The repository is now mirrored properly.

Any new file or changes I make locally can be pushed directly to the mirror repository.
